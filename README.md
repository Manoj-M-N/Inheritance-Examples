Single Inheritence -----
Project Description:
This is a simple Java program that demonstrates Single Inheritance using an example from agriculture. The program collects and displays basic details of a crop, including its name, cultivation time, and the required climate.

Features:
Takes input for crop name and cultivation time.
Takes input for climate required for the crop.
Displays all the entered details.
Demonstrates Simple (Single) Inheritance in Java.

MultiLevel Inheritence -----
Description: 
This Java program demonstrates Multilevel Inheritance using an electronics example:
Device → Computer → Laptop
Each class adds its own unique features and collects user input.

Features: 
Brand Name input,
Price input,
Processor selection,
RAM Size selection .

Hierarchical Inheritance -----
Description:
This Java project demonstrates Hierarchical Inheritance where a single parent class Vehicle is inherited by multiple child classes: Car, Bike, and Tractor. Each subclass has unique features while sharing common characteristics from the parent class.

Features:
Parent class: Vehicle,
Child classes: Car, Bike, Tractor,
Shared method: display() (common for all vehicles),
Specific methods: carType(), bikeType(), tractorType().

Multiple Inheritence ----
Description:
This Java program demonstrates multiple inheritance using interfaces.
In this example, the Child class inherits characteristics from both the Father and Mother interfaces, showing how a class can combine behaviors from multiple sources in Java.

 Features:
Demonstrates multiple inheritance via interfaces (allowed in Java).
Shows how one class can inherit properties from multiple parents using interfaces.
Easy-to-understand real-life example: Father, Mother, and Child.
Simple and clean structure for beginners to grasp inheritance concepts.

Hybrid Iheritence ----
Description:
This project demonstrates hybrid inheritance in Java using a combination of:
Single Inheritance
Multilevel Inheritance
Hierarchical Inheritance
Multiple Inheritance via Interface

Features:
Shows single inheritance using Person → Employee,
Demonstrates multilevel inheritance with Person → Employee → TeamLead,
Illustrates hierarchical inheritance with multiple subclasses of Person (Manager, Intern),
Implements multiple inheritance using the FullTime interface,
Simple, real-world example for easy understanding
